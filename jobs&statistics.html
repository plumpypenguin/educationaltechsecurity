                <h3>Jobs & Statistics</h3>
                <p>Interested in the field of cybersecurity? Here are some jobs and statistics that may interest you. You might find something that sparks your interest.</p>
                <button class="accordion">Penetration Testers</button>

                        A penetration tester, or pen tester, is considered to be a white hat or ethical hacker. They are security experts who try and understand attackers’ motives 
                        and approach. Essentially, they must think like a bad guy to identify weaknesses in networks. These weaknesses, or vulnerabilities, must be properly managed 
                        in order to avoid being compromised. Pen testers target operating systems and devices, emerging technology like Internet of Things (IoT) devices, mobile devices, 
                        and much more. They learn about and keep on top of the latest testing and hacking methods, perform social engineering tests, review physical security, locate and 
                        assess vulnerabilities, among other things.

                        Encryption is the process of scrambling data to prevent unauthorized individuals from being able to read and understand this information. This is where cryptographers 
                        and cryptanalysts come into play. They create and decipher codes and puzzles. These security professionals ensure safe communication and information exchange.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cryptographers write ciphers, or algorithms for performing encryption and decryption, and security protocols, or sets of rules, to encrypt data. As more and more information is becoming digital, 
                        cryptographers secure military data, maintain the integrity of electronic medical records and personal health information, and encrypt financial data like bank records, e-commerce activity, 
                        and credit and debit card information. On the flip side, cryptanalysts work to decrypt data, breaking deconstructing algorithms and ciphers in order to access information. By doing so, they 
                        learn how to avoid gaps in security and protect individuals, groups, and organizations.

                <button class="accordion">Malware Analysts</button>

                    <p>
                        Malware analysts are experts that identify threats such as viruses, worms, Trojans, and rootkits. They are professionals who protect digital assets from threats and work with other security 
                        experts in teams. These detectives need to be able to dissect malware code and understand various programming languages so companies can build defenses. Once they define and understand malware code, 
                        they also have to create code that defends the network from these cyber threats. Some malware analysts work for antivirus companies to create definition files to protect end users from the growing list 
                        of malware programs created every day.

                <button class="accordion">Forensics Experts</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>
                        Okay, so we’ve talked about some cybersecurity jobs that deal with protecting against attacks and threats. But what happens after a cybercrime DOES take place? Let’s talk about forensic experts. These security 
                        professionals investigate cyber crimes like data breaches and other security incidents. They gather and inspect evidence from IT equipment, networks, and other settings before submitting this evidence to law enforcement 
                        and other authorities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These individuals often work for large corporations in various industries, legal firms, or governments. Forensics experts retrieve data stored on devices and systems, often dismantling and reconstructing 
                        information and security systems. They meticulously retrace evidence of cybercrime back to the initial breach in order to identify which security vulnerability allowed it. Once they’ve compiled evidence of the cybercrime, they 
                        organize it into clear, detailed, and accessible reports for executives, law enforcement, lawyers, and judges.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Most times, forensics experts need to explain reports, answer questions, and occasionally serve as expert witnesses in court. 
                        The goal of forensics experts is to improve the security of organizations, typically advising executives on system improvements and educating employees about cybersecurity matters.
