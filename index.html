                <h3>About This Website</h3>
                <p>Welcome to our website! It was built by cybersecurity students for our capstone project.</p>
                <p>For this project, we wanted to make something that served a purpose and built on our knowledge.</p>
                <p>As more and more of our lives revolve around the Internet, we decided that an educational website would serve as a great resource for others to visit and learn about various security topics.</p>
                <p>From online banking to gaming to web conferencing, the list goes on and on; the Internet is a great tool that helps make our lives easier and more enjoyable!</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, due to its popularity, some bad actors view the Internet as a gateway for financial gain and use malicious tactics that affect others.</p>
                <p>We wanted to make a website that everyday Intenet users can benefit from and learn how to protect themselves in this digital age.</p>
                <p>Here, you can learn about different types of malware, social engineering, some statistics about cybersecurity, among some other topics.</p>
                <p>So, if you're visiting this website, we hope that it helps you in some way! Thank you for visiting!</p>
